# laborganizer
This is the lab organizer web-page for the Rashidian Lab at Dana Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, MA. 
Here, you can organize and assign weekly lab duties, view current lab members and duties, and add or remove members and duties as needed.

This web application was made and is currently maintained by Ava Knight using Streamlit. Calendar widget code borrowed from @im-perativa on GitHub using FullCalendar code. All other code, algorithms, and design are her own with some borrowed from past projects visible on her GitHub. Images taken from the Rashidian Lab website and Adobe stock images.
